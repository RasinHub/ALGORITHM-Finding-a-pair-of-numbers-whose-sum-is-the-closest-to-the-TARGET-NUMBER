# ALGORITHM - Finding a pair of numbers whose sum is the closest to the TARGET NUMBER
You are given two integer arrays and you are also given a target which is just a number. Let's just say that the problem here is to write a function that takes these three pieces information and returns a pair of numbers that you can make from these two arrays whose sum is the closest to the target.
